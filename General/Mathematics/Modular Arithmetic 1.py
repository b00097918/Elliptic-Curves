#I calculated this using the mod formula.
#This challenge is asking us to find the the value of a. Below is the challenge to solve on Cryptohack.

#11 ≡ x mod 6
#8146798528947 ≡ y mod 17

#I found the value of "x" like so, x = 11 mod 6 
#x = 5

#I repeated the process by doing y = 8146798528947 mod 17
# y = 4


#We are asked to give the smallest integer of the two sums which is 4.
